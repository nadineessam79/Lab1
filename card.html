            <p id="interesting-fact">A giraffe's neck is too tall to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly
                spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water.</p>
            <ul id="facts">
                <li>
                    <span>Scientific Name</span>: Giraffa
                </li>

            <p id="summary">Whilst it was thought that giraffes did not make any sounds, this is now known to be untrue,
                as giraffes bellow, snort, hiss and make flute-like sounds, as well as low pitch noises beyond the range
                of human hearing.
